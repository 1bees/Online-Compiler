Online-Compiler
===============

This is a web application where Off-Campus students of BITS Pilani could login with their credentials and use the C, C++, Java and Python compilers

Users could do two things:

* Write code online and compile it.
* Write code offline and submit it on this web interface for the compiler to show results.

This application is developed by Bhargav Golla(https://github.com/bhargavgolla) and Venkat Sandeep(https://github.com/sandy92) under the guidance of Mr.Virendra Shekhawat, Lecturer, Dept. of Computer Science and Information Systems, BITS-Pilani.
